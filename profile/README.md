`Connectiker` is a concept for building micro-services as a lego architecture, meaning that any component is a building block to fast ship a microservice. Each `Connectiker` component does do one thing only and one thing well.

`Connectiker` is a set of packages that help with building Distributed Systems.

```
 +------------------+       +-----------+                                   +---------+         +-----------+
 | My MicroService  |   =   | xConnect  | ----- with pluggable addons --->  | xAddons |     +   | xService  |          
 +------------------+       +----+------+                                   +-----+---+         +-----------+  

```

## xConnect

`xConnect` provides the abstraction layers & managers for pluggable `xAddons` used in a microservice architecture, the basic interfaces & managers to define expectations and vocabulary.

## xAddons

`xAddons` are pluggable components built on top of `xConnect`. They are the core components that make up the `xServices`. They provide an essential foundation for your incoming projects, the core components needed to start a new service. `xAddons` provide the core "building blocks" required to build out your application.

## xService

`xService` is a package for building micro-services, everything that is needed to fast start a new project (a server, a client, a message broker,... etc).
